Hello, my name is Jean-William Perreault, I am a 22 year-old Montreal based,
software developer. I have the reputation of solving problems effectively and efficiently and of being someone that is always ready to go out of his confort zone to find appropriate solutions. My primary way of thinking is outside the box. I am not afraid of challenges and I am constantly seeking ways to improve myself in order to deliver quality work that distinguishes itself by its aesthethics and robustness. 

  
I am fluent in both english and french.
  
I would be happy to help you accomplish your goals, 
tell me about them!
