## Description
Age of JMD is a real time strategy game playable over local network and programmed in Python. 
Each playable game allowed up to 9 simultaneous players. It was an assignment where we had to create such a game in a team of 5-6 developers. 
The development was to be done using the agile development method and following a strict MVC model.

## Responsibilities
I was responsible for integrating the code of the various departments of the game
(graphics, network, artificial intelligence, HUD, sound effect, logic, environment). I also was responsible
for developing the client/server network interface in lockstep as well as for the production of graphic and musical elements.
